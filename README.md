Code lessons for learning Java, with an emphasis on the FIRST Robotics Competition class hierarchy.

This repository is intended to hold lessons and code skeletons for FRC team 2879 members to learn the Java 
programming language.  There will be an emphasis on using the FRC Java class libraries to control a robot.

This repository will also hold lessons and code skeletons for other related tools that we use in building and
programming our robots.

The wiki link (the book-like icon to the right) has more information on the lessons.
